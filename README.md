## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes video streams or images to identify workers with or without helmets.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained with a diverse dataset to ensure robustness in varying lighting and environmental conditions.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for different use cases or additional safety gear detection.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be integrated with edge devices, surveillance systems, or web platforms.
